3. [Upload your strategy to the platform](upload.md): After coding your strategy, upload it to the [AlgoBulls](https://www.algobulls.com/) platform by creating a new strategy and uploading the file.

4. [Run Backtest / Paper Trade / Real Trade using your strategy](testing.md/#submit-a-job): Once your strategy is uploaded, run backtests, paper trades, or real trades on the AlgoBulls platform to evaluate its performance.

5. [Fetch logs during runtime, view reports and statistics, see your order history](testing.md/#fetch-logs): Monitor your strategy's performance by fetching runtime logs, viewing reports and statistics, and checking your order history to see executed trades.
