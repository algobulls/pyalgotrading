# Execute your Strategy

## Previously...
You have uploaded your strategy to the AlgoBulls platform.

---
## Now...
Using the uploaded strategy, you can now try:  

- **Backtesting** 
- **Paper Trading**
- **Real Trading** 

---

## Before you start...
Open a Jupyter Notebook.

The steps you will follow are:

1. Establish a connection to the AlgoBulls Platform.
2. Display all Strategies you have in your account.
3. Select the strategy.
4. Optionally, print the strategy once.
5. Select instrument(s).
6. Submit/Run a Backtest, Paper Trade or Real Trade job.
7. Check Job Status.
8. Fetch Logs (even while the job is running).
9. Fetch Reports. (PnL, Statistics, Order History)

---
## Let's Start...
Run the following code snippets into the Jupyter Notebook one by one (or all together).

### Create a new strategy file
eg: strategy_```<unique_code_if_needed>```_options_ema_crossover.py
Make sure this strategy file is in the same folder as the jupyter notebook.

!!!Tips "Coding Conventions"
    * Keep a unique file name
    * Make sure that the file name is in lowercase and that each word is separated with an underscore '_' as shown above.


!!!Tips "How to Code ?"
    To know more on how to code trading strategies and understand their format, click [here](strategy_guides/structure.md).
    We have in detail explanation for [regular strategies](strategy_guides/common_regular_strategy.md) as well as [options strategies](strategy_guides/common_options_strategy.md)


### Import statements

```python
from pyalgotrading.algobulls import AlgoBullsConnection
from datetime import datetime as dt
from pyalgotrading.constants import *
```

---
### Establish a connection to the AlgoBulls Platform

```python
algobulls_connection = AlgoBullsConnection()
algobulls_connection.get_authorization_url()
```
The output of the above step is:

`Please login to this URL with your AlgoBulls credentials and get your developer access token: https://app.algobulls.com/user/login`

!!! info "Get Developer Key"
    You will need to log in to your AlgoBulls account and fetch the access token from:  ([See How](prerequisites.md/#algobulls-account){target="_blank"})  
    **Settings** -> **General** -> **Developer Options**  
    

Once you have the access token, set it in the code as shown here:

```python
algobulls_connection.set_access_token('4365817b795770ea31040a21ad29c8e78b63ad88')
```

Replace the token you have copied with the token in the code above.

---
#### Display all strategies in your account
---

```python
all_strategies = algobulls_connection.get_all_strategies()
all_strategies
```

An example of the output will be:
![Output](output.png "Sample Output")

### Select the strategy

Select the last entry of the `strategyCode` column and display it.
```python
strategy_code = all_strategies.iloc[-1]['strategyCode']
strategy_code
```

---
### Print your Strategy code

You can print your strategy code once to verify if this is the correct code. This step is optional.

```python
strategy_details1 = algobulls_connection.get_strategy_details(strategy_code)
print(strategy_details1)
```

---
### Search for instruments (based on a search query)

Now display a few instruments with some keyword. The example below uses 'SBIN' as the keyword.

```python
instruments = algobulls_connection.search_instrument('SBIN')
instruments
```

--- 
### Select an instrument

From the output, select the instrument on which you wish to test your strategy. For this example, select the first one.
```python
instrument = instruments[0]['value']
instrument
```

---
### Submit a Job

Delete previous trades
```python
algobulls_connection.delete_previous_trades(strategy=strategy)
```

Set the **parameters** for the strategy
```python

parameters={
    'timeperiod1': 5,
    'timeperiod2': 12
}
```

```python
vendor_details = {
    'brokerName': '<VENDOR_NAME>',
    'credentialParameters': {
        'api_key': '<API_KEY>',
        'secret_key': '<SECRET_KEY>'
    }
}
```

```python
broking_details = {
    'brokerName': '<BROKER_NAME>',
    'credentialParameters': {
        'user_id': '<USER_ID>',
        'api_key': '<API_KEY>',
        'password': '<PASSWORD>'
    }
}
```

### Fetch logs

!!! Tip "Logging Tip"
    - There are 2 variations when fetching logs:  
        - Progressive Logs (`print_live_logs` = True):  will show progress bar and update the latest logs as the strategy is executed
        - Complete Logs (`print_live_logs` = False): will fetch logs after strategy is executed.(It wont update the latest logs, unless called manually again)

Click on each of the tabs to see the relevant code snippet.  

=== "**Backtesting**"
    ```python
    logs = algobulls_connection.get_backtesting_logs(
                strategy_code,                              # strategy code 
                display_progress_bar=True,                  # (default=True) to track the execution on progress bar as your strategy is executed
                print_live_logs: True                       # (default=False) to print the live logs as your strategy is executed
            )
    print(logs)
    ```
    
=== "**Paper Trading**"
    ```python
    logs = algobulls_connection.get_papertrading_logs(
                strategy_code,                              # strategy code 
                display_progress_bar=True,                  # (default=True) to track the execution on progress bar as your strategy is executed
                print_live_logs: True                       # (default=True) to print the live logs as your strategy is executed
            )
    print(logs)
    ```
    
=== "**Real Trading**"
    ```python
    logs = algobulls_connection.get_realtrading_logs(
                strategy_code,                              # strategy code 
                display_progress_bar=True,                  # (default=True) to track the execution on progress bar as your strategy is executed
                print_live_logs: True                       # (default=True) to print the live logs as your strategy is executed
