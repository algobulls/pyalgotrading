**User Parameters:** In this section, you can customize/create your own parameters for the strategy. Click on **+Add New Parameter** to begin adding them. They should match with the parameters you have defined in your Python class.

Once Strategy and User Parameters are configured, you can follow these steps to execute your strategy.

**Step 2**

In the **customizations** section choose **Backtesting** to back test or **Paper Trading** to Paper Trade a strategy.

Select the duration option in the customizations section. Add the desired date and time, as well as the quantity/lots. In Backtesting you will need to put the start date and end date along with time.

In Paper Trading you only need to add the start and end time.
