A new blank code editor will open, allowing you to start coding your new strategy. You can check out the basic building blocks of a strategy [here](https://algobulls.github.io/pyalgotrading/structure/) to help you with your code structure. After you've finished coding, click **Save** to save this strategy in the **My Coded Strategies** section.

Next, you need to configure the strategyâ€™s parameters by clicking on the settings symbol in the top right corner of the code editor. In this section you can add, view & edit the strategy parameters.

To test the behaviour and performance of the strategy, click on **Save & Start** and follow the directions given earlier. The performance of the strategy will soon be available in the **Results** section.

You can rename a strategy by clicking the edit symbol besides the strategy name.
