## Formulae
---

* Net PnL: The cumulative backtesting P&L. This is the sum of all the Absolute P&L values of the previous trades.
  
      `pnl_absolute = (exit_price - entry_price)*exit_quantity` for a long trade

      `pnl_absolute = (entry_price - exit_price)*exit_quantity` for a short trade
 
* Max Drawdown %: The maximum loss your strategy has encountered during the execution in percentage.
  
      `max_drowdown_percentage = (Max Drawdown) / (corresponding entry_price) // exit _ quantity x 100`

* Avg. Profit per winning trade: Cumulative Profit for winning trades divided by No. of Wins.
  
      `avg_profit_per_winning_trade = (Total P&L of winning trades) / (Count of winning trades)`

* Avg. Profit per losing trade: Cumulative Loss for winning trades divided by No. of Wins.
  
      `avg_profit_per_losing_trade = (Total P&L of losing trades) / (Count of losing trades)`
