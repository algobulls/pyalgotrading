You can add funds to your wallet by clicking the `+ Add Money` button.

All your actions like backtesting, paper trading and real trading are charged according to the funds in your wallet (wherever charges are applicable).

Your funds keep decreasing as and when you are charged, and once the funds become zero, your account stops trading.

If your actions are going to be quite extensive, then consider opting for packages/plans to get more economical benefits. See the [`Models`](#models) section described next to know more!

## Models

There are 2 models:

* `Pay-per-use Model`: In this model, you add money into your AlgoBulls Wallet. As you run and use various services, you are charged for those services.

    Use the [Fund Book](Books/fundbook.md) to track the usage charges.To know more, see [here](#plans-for-the-pay-per-use-model).

* `Subscription Model`: Visit the [Plans & Wallet](https://app.algobulls.com/wallet) page of your account and select a plan suitable for you.

    As an example, if you activate a plan of 1000 INR for Backtesting services for 30 days, then you may use the Backtesting service without incurring any additional charges for the next 30 days.

    However, for this same example, the Real Trading service will still be chargeable as per the `Pay-per-use Model` because the subscription you have chosen does not include this service.

    Use the [Fund Book](Books/fundbook.md) to track the usage charges. To know more, see [here](#plans-for-the-subscription-model).

For both the models, the following actions are common and free:

| Action                                                   | Cost |
