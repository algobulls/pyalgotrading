## 1. What is an Issuer?

A legal entity that manages, registers, and sells securities to support its operations financially is an Issuer. There can be many types of Issuers - Corporations, Domestic or Foreign Governments and Investment trusts. Issuers develop securities such as Bonds, Debentures, G-Secs & NCDs.
