[![PTB](imgs/virtual_mode_retail_marketplace.png "Click to Enlarge or Ctrl+Click to open in a new Tab")](imgs/virtual_mode_retail_marketplace.png)

Also ensure that you’ve added a strategy from the [Choose Strategy](choose-strategy.md) marketplace by clicking on the **execute** button.

**Step 1**

In the [My Portfolio](live-trading.md) section click on the **Start** button in the Action column. 

[![PTB](imgs/virtual_mode_my_portfolio.png "Click to Enlarge or Ctrl+Click to open in a new Tab")](imgs/virtual_mode_my_portfolio.png)

A pop-up window will appear. The AlgoBulls **virtual broker** is the default broker selected in the **choose broker** option.

**Step 2**

In the **customizations** section choose **back data for backtesting** or **live data for paper trading**. 

[![PTB](imgs/ptb6.png "Click to Enlarge or Ctrl+Click to open in a new Tab")](imgs/ptb6.png)

Select the duration option in the customizations section. Add the desired date and time, as well as the quantity/lots. In backtesting you will need to put the start date and end date along with time. 

[![PTB](imgs/ptb7.png "Click to Enlarge or Ctrl+Click to open in a new Tab")](imgs/ptb7.png)

In paper trading you only need to add the start and end time. 

**Step 3**

Once you scroll below you will see the P&L tracker. Switch the P&L tracker **ON** and enter your desired profit and risk appetite.

You will be able to track the Backtesting or Paper Trading status in the Progress section.
