All of your actions, such as backtesting, paper trading, and live trading, are charged depending on the amount in your wallet (wherever charges are applicable).

Your funds are reduced as you are charged, and when they reach zero, your account stops trading.

You can consider opting for [subscription plans](https://app.algobulls.com/wallet?defaultCategory=smartPlans) to get more cost-effective benefits.

Here’s a quick explainer on how you can subscribe to a package of your choice. 

## 3. How to subscribe to a plan?

To subscribe to a plan, you can choose a package of your choice from the plans & wallet section.

These plans are active for a specific time duration. Hence all services included in the package will not incur any additional charges for that period.

### Example

If you activate a smart plan in **Live Trading** for equity strategy services for 1180 INR for 30 days, you will be able to use the service without incurring any further expenses for the next 30 days.

If you wish to **backtest a strategy**, the subscription selected  by you does not include **virtual services**. This means **virtual trading services** will continue to be charged and you will have to subscribe to virtual trading plans or  pay-as-you-go to use these services. 

Ensure you keep a track of the usage costs by checking the [Fund Book](https://app.algobulls.com/book/fund). You can add money or subscribe to a plan from the Plans and Wallet section.
