## How to view the Results?

Once you start the strategy, it may take a while for it to complete the execution. You can Switch to the Results tab after you run your strategy.  Even if the strategy execution is not complete, you will still see intermediate results.

Only Premium developer plans users will be able to view the strategy analytics values & graphs.
