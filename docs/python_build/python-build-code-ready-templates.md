Follow these simple steps to test the strategy's performance

**Step 1**

After clicking **Save & Start**, a pop-up window will appear.

**Step 2**

In the **customizations** section choose **Backtesting** to back test or **Paper Trading** to Paper Trade a strategy.

Select the duration option in the customizations section. Add the desired date and time, as well as the quantity/lots. In Backtesting you will need to put the start date and end date along with time.

In Paper Trading you only need to add the start and end time.

**Step 3**

Once you scroll below, you will see the P&L tracker. Switch the P&L tracker ON and enter your desired profit and risk appetite. To keep things simple, you can also leave it turned off.
