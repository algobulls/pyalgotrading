## 3. How to get started with Python Build?
---

To start developing your own strategy, you must first activate a plan from the **[Plans & Wallet](https://app.algobulls.com/wallet)** section. Select the **[Developers](https://app.algobulls.com/wallet?category=Developers)** option in the **Explore Plans** section and select a plan of your choice. There are currently two developer plans available:

[![pythonbuild](imgs/python_build_plans.png "Click to Enlarge or Ctrl+Click to open in a new Tab")](imgs/python_build_plans.png)


* **Premium Developer Plan**: Develop your own Algorithmic Trading Strategy with Analytics support, concurrent Strategy Executions, Professional Support, and more.

* **Free Developer Plan**: Develop your own Algorithmic Trading Strategy for Free.

After selecting your preferred plan, you will be able to begin coding. You can either edit the preloaded **Ready templates** or use **My Coded Strategies** section to create your own strategies

## 4. How to code strategies using Ready Templates?
---

[![pythonbuild](imgs/python_build_ready_templates.png "Click to Enlarge or Ctrl+Click to open in a new Tab")](imgs/python_build_ready_templates.png)

Select a template that you would like to modify from the **Ready Template** section. To view all the ready-to-use templates click on **[More](https://app.algobulls.com/build/python?key=samplestrategies)**.

[![pythonbuild](imgs/python_build_all_ready_templates.png "Click to Enlarge or Ctrl+Click to open in a new Tab")](imgs/python_build_all_ready_templates.png)

Click on the **Code button** placed in the bottom right corner of the selected template to view the strategy code.

[![pythonbuild](imgs/python_build_selected_strategy.png "Click to Enlarge or Ctrl+Click to open in a new Tab")](imgs/python_build_selected_strategy.png)

You should now see the **code editor**, where you can start modifying the code as required.

[![pythonbuild](imgs/python_build_code_edit.png "Click to Enlarge or Ctrl+Click to open in a new Tab")](imgs/python_build_code_edit.png)

To save the strategy, click the Save button. This strategy will be added to your list of **My coded strategies**.

[![pythonbuild](imgs/python_build_save_strategy.png "Click to Enlarge or Ctrl+Click to open in a new Tab")](imgs/python_build_save_strategy.png)

Follow these simple steps to test the strategy's performance

**Step 1**

After clicking **Save & Start**, a pop-up window will appear.

[![pythonbuild](imgs/python_build_save_and_start.png "Click to Enlarge or Ctrl+Click to open in a new Tab")](imgs/python_build_save_and_start.png)

**Step 2**

In the **customizations** section choose **Backtesting** to back test or **Paper Trading** to Paper Trade a strategy.

Select the duration option in the customizations section. Add the desired date and time, as well as the quantity/lots. In Backtesting you will need to put the start date and end date along with time.

[![pythonbuild](imgs/python_build_backtesting.png "Click to Enlarge or Ctrl+Click to open in a new Tab")](imgs/python_build_backtesting.png)

In Paper Trading you only need to add the start and end time.

[![pythonbuild](imgs/python_build_papertesting.png "Click to Enlarge or Ctrl+Click to open in a new Tab")](imgs/python_build_papertesting.png)

**Step 3**

Once you scroll below, you will see the P&L tracker. Switch the P&L tracker ON and enter your desired profit and risk appetite. To keep things simple, you can also leave it turned off.

[![pythonbuild](imgs/python_build_pnl.png "Click to Enlarge or Ctrl+Click to open in a new Tab")](imgs/python_build_pnl.png)

**Step 4**

In the Configuration section, you can check the parameters added or modified by you.
 
**Step 5**

To begin testing the strategy, click on Execute.

If you want to create your own strategy, click on the **+ Sign** in the **Code New Strategy** option under the **My Coded Strategies** section.

[![pythonbuild](imgs/python_build_new_strategy.png "Click to Enlarge or Ctrl+Click to open in a new Tab")](imgs/python_build_new_strategy.png)

A new blank code editor will open, allowing you to start coding your new strategy. You can check out the basic building blocks of a strategy [here](https://algobulls.github.io/pyalgotrading/structure/) to help you with your code structure. After you've finished coding, click **Save** to save this strategy in the **My Coded Strategies** section.
