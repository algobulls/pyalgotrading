## What is Chat-GPT ?
Generative AI involves creating new content using machine learning. A key method is GANs, where a generator creates data and a discriminator evaluates its realism. Another method is VAEs, which encode and decode data. ChatGPT is a specific AI model using generative text, like a conversation. It can understand context, answer questions, and generate text in a human-like manner. It finds use in various fields, from text generation to customer service, but also raises concerns about accuracy and responsible use.

## Why we use Chat-GPT ?
ChatGPT can assist in generating code for algorithmic trading strategies. It can translate strategy ideas into code snippets, provide coding guidance, and help with customization. However, human expertise is essential to validate, optimize, and manage risks in the complex realm of algorithmic trading.
