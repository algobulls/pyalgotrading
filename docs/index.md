## [Python Build](python_build/index.md)

---
The Python Build service is a powerful platform that offers users the flexibility to create their own trading strategies from scratch or make modifications to existing templates. It provides them with the ability to leverage the [AlgoBulls](https://www.algobulls.com/) Core Trading Engine, an advanced trading system, and gain access to historical data for evaluating and improving the performance of their strategies.
With Python Build, users have the freedom to write their trading algorithms from the ground up, allowing for complete customization and control over the logic and functionality of their strategies. Alternatively, they can modify pre-existing templates, which saves time and effort while still enabling them to tailor the strategy to their specific needs.
One of the key advantages of the Python Build service is that it grants users the ability to tweak parameters, making it easy to fine-tune their strategies and observe the impact on performance in real-time. This feature empowers traders to optimize their algorithms for desired outcomes and increase the likelihood of successful trading.
In addition to parameter tweaking, Python Build also provides users with the capability to view visual analytics. This feature allows for in-depth analysis and visualization of strategy performance, providing traders with valuable insights and enabling them to make data-driven decisions. By analyzing comprehensive data metrics and charts, users can identify patterns, uncover trends, and refine their strategies for enhanced profitability
