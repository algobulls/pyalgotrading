## Limitations of **Python Build**

In the exciting world of algorithmic trading, **Python Build** stands as a formidable tool, offering a range of benefits and considerations for traders and developers. Let's also know the limitations to help you make an informed decision.
<p align="center">
  <img src="imgs/pros_n_cons.svg" alt="algo trading basic image", width="400px"/>
</p>

1. **Python Speed Limitations:** While versatile, Python isn't the fastest language for computation. This might pose challenges with complex strategies requiring extensive calculations. Our team is working on porting a majority of the codebase on Cython to help with the speedup, while maintaining the simplicity of Python. We may explore other avenues like GPUs in the future.
2. **Cloud Cold-Start Speed Limitations:** We execute every strategy on a dedicated virtual server in the cloud. While this is great as every strategy is executed in a separate secure environment with dedicated resources, it takes time to fetch the dedicated resource on the cloud before the strategy execution can start. This results in an initial small delay while starting a strategy.

!!! tip "Note"
    Our team is working round the clock to make these limitations a thing of the past.
