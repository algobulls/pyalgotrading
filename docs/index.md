## Limitations of **Phoenix**

In the exciting world of algorithmic trading, **Phoenix** offers numerous benefits and considerations for traders and developers. Let's also acknowledge its limitations to help you make an informed decision.
<p align="center">
  <img src="imgs/pros_n_cons.svg" alt="algo trading basic image", width="400px"/>
</p>

1. **Python Speed Limitations:**  While versatile, Python isn't the fastest language for computation. This may pose challenges for complex strategies requiring extensive calculations. Our team is actively transitioning a major part of the codebase to Cython to enhance speed while retaining Python's simplicity. We're also exploring options like GPUs for the future.

2. **Cloud Cold-Start Speed Limitations:** Each strategy runs on a dedicated virtual server in the cloud. While this ensures secure execution with dedicated resources, there's a short delay as the cloud fetches the resource before strategy execution begins. This minor delay is part of our ongoing optimization efforts.


!!! tip "Note"
    Our team is working round the clock to make these limitations a thing of the past.
