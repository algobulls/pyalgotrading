## [PythonBuild](python_build/index.md)

The PythonBuild service allows users to code their own trading strategy from scratch or modify templates. Users can access the [AlgoBulls](https://www.algobulls.com/) Core Trading Engine and historical data to gauge strategy performance. Users can tweak parameters and view
visual analytics to improve performance. Once approved, the strategy can be deployed on 30+ supported brokers without needing to code any integration logic.
